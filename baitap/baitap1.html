    <p style="color:blue ;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of the webpage</p>
    <p style="color:red ;">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between alements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be Ãºed, different dislays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>
    <p class="styleCat">Tip: The world cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)</p>
